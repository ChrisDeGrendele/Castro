To Do:
 - Fix the shock coming out of the BC from the right side in the radiative case
 - Dig up SN remnant solution
 - Make plot again with V/R thing with front tracker...
 - This will be wrong ^ play with oppacities to try to mimmick what the blondin paper is doing
 - compare castro opacities to blondin cooling function. Come up with some solution that does the same thing...
