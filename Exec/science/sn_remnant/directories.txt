Blondin/ is an attempt to recreate the blondin paper.

sn_remnant/ is an attempt to turn sedov into a radiaive case. Then let it run for significant time. In order for a radiative shock to occur.

Instability_test is a bump with a radiaivte shock coming through

Instability_test_no_r/ is the same as above but with no radiation. The purpose is to compare instabilities in a radiaition vs non radiative case.
